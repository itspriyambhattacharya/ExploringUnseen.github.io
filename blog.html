                    <p>Nanda Devi is the second highest mountain in India after Kangchenjunga, the highest located
                        entirely within the country. (Kangchenjunga, which is higher, is on the border of India and
                        Nepal.) It is the 23rd-highest peak in the world. It was considered the highest mountain in the
                        world before computations in 1808 proved Dhaulagiri to be higher. It was also the highest
                        mountain in India until 1975 when Sikkim, an independent kingdom until 1948, and a protectorate
                        of India thereafter became a part of the Republic of India. It is part of the Kumaon
                        Himalayas,[3] and is located in Garhwal region in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, between the
                        Rishiganga valley on the west and the Goriganga valley on the east. The peak, whose name means
                        "Bliss-Giving Goddess",is regarded as the patron goddess of the Garhwal and Kumaon
                        Himalayas. In acknowledgment of its religious significance and for the protection of its fragile
                        ecosystem, the peak as well as the circle of high mountains surrounding it—the Nanda Devi
                        sanctuary—were closed to both locals and climbers in 1983. The surrounding Nanda Devi National
                        Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988.</p>
                    <p>Nanda Devi is a two-peaked massif, forming a 2-kilometre-long (1.2 mi) high ridge, oriented
                        east-west. The western summit is higher, and the eastern summit, called Nanda Devi East,
                        (locally known as Sunanda Devi) is the lower one. The main summit stands guarded by a barrier
                        ring comprising some of the highest mountains in the Indian Himalayas, twelve of which exceed
                        6,400 metres (21,000 ft) in height, further elevating its sacred status as the daughter of the
                        Himalaya in Indian myth and folklore. The interior of this almost insurmountable ring is known
                        as the Nanda Devi Sanctuary, and is protected as the Nanda Devi National Park. Nanda Devi East
                        lies on the eastern edge of the ring (and of the Park), at the border of Chamoli, Pithoragarh
                        and Bageshwar districts.

                        Together the peaks may be referred to as the peaks of the goddesses Nanda and Sunanda. These
                        goddesses have occurred together in ancient Sanskrit literature (Srimad Bhagvatam or Bhagavata
                        Purana) and are worshipped together as twins in the Kumaon, Garhwal and elsewhere in India. The
                        first published reference to Nanda Devi East as Sunanda Devi appears to be in a recent novel
                        (Malhotra 2011) that has the Kumaon region as backdrop.

                        In addition to being the 23rd highest independent peak in the world, Nanda Devi is also notable
                        for its large, steep rise above local terrain. It rises over 3,300 metres (10,800 ft) above its
                        immediate southwestern base on the Dakkhini Nanda Devi Glacier in about 4.2 kilometres (2.6 mi),
                        and its rise above the glaciers to the north is similar. This makes it among the steepest peaks
                        in the world at this scale, closely comparable, for example, to the local profile of K2. Nanda
                        Devi is also impressive when considering terrain that is a bit further away, as it is surrounded
                        by relatively deep valleys. For example, it rises over 6,500 metres (21,300 ft) above the valley
                        of the Goriganga in only 50 km (30 mi).

                        On the northern side of the massif lies the Uttari Nanda Devi Glacier, flowing into the Uttari
                        Rishi Glacier. To the southwest, one finds the Dakkhini Nanda Devi Glacier, flowing into the
                        Dakkhini Rishi Glacier. All of these glaciers are located within the Sanctuary, and drain west
                        into the Rishiganga. To the east lies the Pachu Glacier, and to the southeast lie the
                        Nandaghunti and Lawan Glaciers, feeding the Lawan Gad; all of these drain into the Milam Valley.
                        To the south is the Pindari Glacier, draining into the Pindar River. Just to the south of
                        Sunanda Devi, dividing the Lawan Gad drainage from the Dakkhini Nanda Devi Glacier, is Longstaff
                        Col, 5,910 m (19,390 ft), one of the high passes that guard access to the Nanda Devi
                        Sanctuary.[6] For a list of notable peaks of the Sanctuary and its environs, see Nanda Devi
                        National Park. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="postdes">
                    <p>Rohtang Pass (Rohtang , lit: རོ་ (Ro)- suvanch, ཐང་། (thang)- plain/field ) is named as such
                        due to people working in bad weather trying to cross the pass) . It is a high
                        mountain pass (elevation 3,980 m (13,058 ft)) on the eastern end of the Pir Panjal Range of the
                        Himalayas around 51 km (32 mi) from Manali. It connects the Kullu Valley with the Lahaul and
                        Spiti Valleys of Himachal Pradesh, India. <br> The pass provides a natural divide between the
                        Kullu Valley with a primarily sanatani culture (in the south), and the arid high-altitude Lahaul
                        and Spiti valleys with a Buddhist culture (in the north). The pass lies on the watershed between
                        the Chenab and Beas basins. On the southern side of this pass, the Beas River emerges from
                        underground and flows southward[6] and on its northern side, the Chandra River (flows from the
                        eastern Himalayas), a source stream of the river Chenab, flows westward. <br> <br> The pass is
                        open from May to November. It is not particularly high or difficult to cross on foot by
                        Himalayan standards, but it has a well-deserved reputation for being dangerous because of
                        unpredictable snowstorms and blizzards.

                        This pass is an ancient trade route between the people on either side of Pir Panjal. The local
                        name for this pass is a generic name of pass.[citation needed] There are many other passes in
                        Lahaul and Spiti which have specific names (Kunzam La, Baralacha La, etc.). This is suggestive
                        of the fact that this must have been the oldest and most frequented pass in the region, or the
                        fact that it is the main pass leading from one cultural region to another, quite different one,
                        to the north. The name Rohtang comes from Persian/ Farsi words Ruh+ Tang which means pile of
                        dead bodies.[citation needed]

                        The former National Highway 21 (NH 21, now numbered NH 3), the road through the Kullu Valley,
                        terminates at Manali. The road northwards over the Rohtang Pass to Keylong in Lahaul and Spiti
                        district and on to Leh in Ladakh is not a national highway. Nonetheless, the Leh-Manali Highway
                        has become very busy during the summer months as an alternate military route since the Kargil
                        Conflict in 1999. Traffic jams are common as military vehicles, trucks, and goods carriers try
                        to navigate the tight roads and rough terrain, compounded by snow and ice at certain points and
                        the large number of tourist vehicles. <br><br> As the pass gets blocked by snow and the road
                        over the pass closes from November to May rendering Lahaul and Spiti districts north of the pass
                        inaccessible, a need was felt to build a tunnel under the pass. The project was announced by the
                        then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on 3 June 2000. The work was entrusted to BRO on 6 May
                        2002. The foundation stone of the project was laid on 28 June 2010 by Sonia Gandhi in her
                        capacity as the Chairperson of National Advisory Council. The road tunnel called Atal Tunnel has
                        been excavated and became operational on 3rd October 2020 after formal inauguration by Prime
                        Minister Narendra Modi. It obviates the need to travel over the Rohtang Pass. While it takes 4
                        to 6 hours to ascend, negotiate and descend the Rohtang Pass, travel through the Rohtang Tunnel
                        takes only about 30 minutes. </p>

All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. <br><br> At sunrise, the peaks of Kanchenjunga are illuminated before the sun is seen at lower elevations. From Tiger Hill, Mount Everest (8848 m) is just visible. Kanchenjunga (8598 m) looks higher than Mt. Everest, owing to the curvature of the Earth, as it is several miles closer than Everest. The distance in a straight line from Tiger Hill to Everest is 107 miles (172 km).

                        On a clear day, Kurseong is visible to the south and in the distance, along with Teesta River, Mahananda River, Balason River and Mechi River meandering down to the south. Chumal Rhi mountain of Tibet, 84 miles (135 km) away, is visible over the Chola range.</p>

                <div class="postdes">
                    <p>St. Mary's Islands, also known as Coconut Island and Thonsepar, are a set of four small islands in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Malpe in Udupi, Karnataka, India. They are known for their distinctive geological formation of columnar rhyolitic lava (pictured).

                        Scientific studies indicate that the basalt of the St. Mary's Islands was formed by sub-aerial subvolcanic activity, because at that time Madagascar was attached to India. The rifting of Madagascar took place around 88 million years ago.
                        
                        Columnar rhyolite Lava here form one of the four geological monuments in Karnataka state, one of the 34 National Geological Monuments of India declared by the Geological Survey of India in 2016 for their protection, maintenance, promotion and enhancement of geotourism. The monument is considered an important site for "Geo Tourism". <br><br> In the year 1498, Vasco da Gama landed at St Mary's Islands on his journey from the Kingdom of Portugal, he fixed a cross on the island and named one of these islands O Padrão de Santa Maria in Portuguese, as a dedication to the Blessed Mother Mary before proceeding to Kozhikode (Calicut) in the Malabar coast of Kerala. It is from this name that the islands got their current name. <br><br> Out of the four islands, the northernmost island has a basaltic rock formation in a hexagonal form, the only one of its type in India such as Malpe and others. The island covers an area which is about 500 m (1,640.4 ft) in length with a width of 100 m (328.1 ft). It has prominent coconut trees, its cover reflecting an azure south sea colour, and hence the island is also called Coconut Island. There is no habitation on the islands.

                        The north-south aligned islands form a non-continuous chain. The four largest islands are Coconut Island, North Island, Daryabahadurgarh Island and South Island.
                        
                        The islands are generally aligned parallel to the coast line, which provide clues to the phenomenon of uplift of the west coast of India. The islands' terraces and elevated beach deposits along with the tide gauge data at the dead oyster beach in Suratkal (further south of the islands) have been deduced as proof of the reported fall in sea level of about 1 mm/per year.
                        
                        The highest elevation at Coconut Island, which has generated interest among geologists and tourists, is about 10 m (32.8 ft) above msl with surrounding areas in the form of platforms in the elevation range of +6 m (19.7 ft), +3 m (9.8 ft), +1.5 m (4.9 ft) and + 0 m which are stated to have been formed by wave action pointing to an "episodic sea level rise or fall of land" <br><br> The columnar basaltic lava found in these Islands, which is very well developed in the basalts of Deccan Traps, exhibit an imposing range of hexagonal shaped or multi-faced (polygonal) columns split into a horizontal mosaic. In geological terms these are called "columnar joints".[1] The lava rocks form regular five, six or seven-sided pillars, called "laminar lava", and are found in varying heights in all the islands; the tallest of the columns is about 6 m (20 ft). Considering the importance and rarity of such an occurrence, these islands were classified as a National Geological Monument in 2001 by the Geological Survey of India. <br><br> There are different theories on the age of the St. Mary's Islands rocks. In the analysis reported in the above section it has been further concluded that the multi domain (MD) state found in these rocks are uncommon in the Deccan Traps and non-existent in the Rajmahal Traps. Six selected samples from the islands were subject to whole rock K-Ar dating. This yielded a mean age of 93.1±2.4 (2σ) vis-à-vis the age of the Rajmahal Traps of about 105-100 Ma and about 66-35 Ma of the Deccan Traps. With this appreciation, the author has concluded that the igneous activity of St. Mary's Islands may represent Cretaceous-Tertiary igneous activity.[11]

                        In a further analysis of the age of the break-up of Greater India (India plus Seychelles) and Madagascar it has been inferred to have occurred in the Upper Cretaceous at 88 Ma. The strength of this inference is based on the approach that the Felsic volcanics (rhyolites and Rhyodacites) of the St. Mary's Islands (SMI), Southern India, were originally interpreted as a distant outlier of the 66 Ma Deccan volcanic province of west–central India, comprising dominantly flood basalts. Later studies had dated it at 93 Ma by the K-Ar dating technique. Since the technique used was a simple use of an average of five out of six widely varying dates and arbitrary data selectivity chosen, the results were not considered reliable. A method of 40Ar–39Ar (argon–argon dating) of the SMI volcanic yields is reportedly more reliable of the plateau and isochron ages. The weighted mean isochron age is reported to be 85.6±0.9 Ma (2σ). The K–Ar (potassium-argon dating) technique adopted for the southern Indian Precambrian terrain, intruded by numerous mafic–doleritic dyke swarms, the age from Proterozoic to the latest Cretaceous is reported as 69–66 Ma (Deccan-related). The two regional dykes (a leucograbbro and a felsite) from the Kerala region of southwestern India, which were also dated earlier, indicate the age as 85 Ma. Madagascar flood basalt province's 40Ar–39Ar ages of 89–85 Ma tallies with the SMI volcanic age. The conclusion drawn by the study is that the Madagascar flood basalt province, the SMI volcanics, and possibly the Kerala dykes may well represent volcanic activity associated with the break-up of Greater India and Madagascar, in the Upper Cretaceous at 88 Ma.[13]
                        
                        Another scientific study on the biogeographic and tectonic history of India reported that:[14] "Although real breaks among the lands were indicated by the physical data, faunal links were maintained by agile animals that were able to surmount minor marine barriers. India, during its northward journey, remained close to Africa and Madagascar even as it began to contact Eurasia."</p>
