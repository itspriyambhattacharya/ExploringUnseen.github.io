                    <p>Nanda Devi is the second highest mountain in India after Kangchenjunga, the highest located
                        entirely within the country. (Kangchenjunga, which is higher, is on the border of India and
                        Nepal.) It is the 23rd-highest peak in the world. It was considered the highest mountain in the
                        world before computations in 1808 proved Dhaulagiri to be higher. It was also the highest
                        mountain in India until 1975 when Sikkim, an independent kingdom until 1948, and a protectorate
                        of India thereafter became a part of the Republic of India. It is part of the Kumaon
                        Himalayas,[3] and is located in Garhwal region in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, between the
                        Rishiganga valley on the west and the Goriganga valley on the east. The peak, whose name means
                        "Bliss-Giving Goddess",[5] is regarded as the patron goddess of the Garhwal and Kumaon
                        Himalayas. In acknowledgment of its religious significance and for the protection of its fragile
                        ecosystem, the peak as well as the circle of high mountains surrounding it—the Nanda Devi
                        sanctuary—were closed to both locals and climbers in 1983. The surrounding Nanda Devi National
                        Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988.</p>
                    <p>Nanda Devi is a two-peaked massif, forming a 2-kilometre-long (1.2 mi) high ridge, oriented
                        east-west. The western summit is higher, and the eastern summit, called Nanda Devi East,
                        (locally known as Sunanda Devi) is the lower one. The main summit stands guarded by a barrier
                        ring comprising some of the highest mountains in the Indian Himalayas, twelve of which exceed
                        6,400 metres (21,000 ft) in height, further elevating its sacred status as the daughter of the
                        Himalaya in Indian myth and folklore. The interior of this almost insurmountable ring is known
                        as the Nanda Devi Sanctuary, and is protected as the Nanda Devi National Park. Nanda Devi East
                        lies on the eastern edge of the ring (and of the Park), at the border of Chamoli, Pithoragarh
                        and Bageshwar districts.

                        Together the peaks may be referred to as the peaks of the goddesses Nanda and Sunanda. These
                        goddesses have occurred together in ancient Sanskrit literature (Srimad Bhagvatam or Bhagavata
                        Purana) and are worshipped together as twins in the Kumaon, Garhwal and elsewhere in India. The
                        first published reference to Nanda Devi East as Sunanda Devi appears to be in a recent novel
                        (Malhotra 2011) that has the Kumaon region as backdrop.

                        In addition to being the 23rd highest independent peak in the world, Nanda Devi is also notable
                        for its large, steep rise above local terrain. It rises over 3,300 metres (10,800 ft) above its
                        immediate southwestern base on the Dakkhini Nanda Devi Glacier in about 4.2 kilometres (2.6 mi),
                        and its rise above the glaciers to the north is similar. This makes it among the steepest peaks
                        in the world at this scale, closely comparable, for example, to the local profile of K2. Nanda
                        Devi is also impressive when considering terrain that is a bit further away, as it is surrounded
                        by relatively deep valleys. For example, it rises over 6,500 metres (21,300 ft) above the valley
                        of the Goriganga in only 50 km (30 mi).[6]

                        On the northern side of the massif lies the Uttari Nanda Devi Glacier, flowing into the Uttari
                        Rishi Glacier. To the southwest, one finds the Dakkhini Nanda Devi Glacier, flowing into the
                        Dakkhini Rishi Glacier. All of these glaciers are located within the Sanctuary, and drain west
                        into the Rishiganga. To the east lies the Pachu Glacier, and to the southeast lie the
                        Nandaghunti and Lawan Glaciers, feeding the Lawan Gad; all of these drain into the Milam Valley.
                        To the south is the Pindari Glacier, draining into the Pindar River. Just to the south of
                        Sunanda Devi, dividing the Lawan Gad drainage from the Dakkhini Nanda Devi Glacier, is Longstaff
                        Col, 5,910 m (19,390 ft), one of the high passes that guard access to the Nanda Devi
                        Sanctuary.[6] For a list of notable peaks of the Sanctuary and its environs, see Nanda Devi
                        National Park. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="postdes">
                    <p>Rohtang Pass (Rohtang , lit: རོ་ (Ro)- suvanch, ཐང་། (thang)- plain/field [1]) is named as such
                        due to people working in bad weather trying to cross the pass) . [2][3][4][5] It is a high
                        mountain pass (elevation 3,980 m (13,058 ft)) on the eastern end of the Pir Panjal Range of the
                        Himalayas around 51 km (32 mi) from Manali. It connects the Kullu Valley with the Lahaul and
                        Spiti Valleys of Himachal Pradesh, India. <br> The pass provides a natural divide between the
                        Kullu Valley with a primarily sanatani culture (in the south), and the arid high-altitude Lahaul
                        and Spiti valleys with a Buddhist culture (in the north). The pass lies on the watershed between
                        the Chenab and Beas basins. On the southern side of this pass, the Beas River emerges from
                        underground and flows southward[6] and on its northern side, the Chandra River (flows from the
                        eastern Himalayas), a source stream of the river Chenab, flows westward. <br> <br> The pass is
                        open from May to November. It is not particularly high or difficult to cross on foot by
                        Himalayan standards, but it has a well-deserved reputation for being dangerous because of
                        unpredictable snowstorms and blizzards.[7]

                        This pass is an ancient trade route between the people on either side of Pir Panjal. The local
                        name for this pass is a generic name of pass.[citation needed] There are many other passes in
                        Lahaul and Spiti which have specific names (Kunzam La, Baralacha La, etc.). This is suggestive
                        of the fact that this must have been the oldest and most frequented pass in the region, or the
                        fact that it is the main pass leading from one cultural region to another, quite different one,
                        to the north. The name Rohtang comes from Persian/ Farsi words Ruh+ Tang which means pile of
                        dead bodies.[citation needed]

                        The former National Highway 21 (NH 21, now numbered NH 3), the road through the Kullu Valley,
                        terminates at Manali. The road northwards over the Rohtang Pass to Keylong in Lahaul and Spiti
                        district and on to Leh in Ladakh is not a national highway. Nonetheless, the Leh-Manali Highway
                        has become very busy during the summer months as an alternate military route since the Kargil
                        Conflict in 1999. Traffic jams are common as military vehicles, trucks, and goods carriers try
                        to navigate the tight roads and rough terrain, compounded by snow and ice at certain points and
                        the large number of tourist vehicles. <br><br> As the pass gets blocked by snow and the road
                        over the pass closes from November to May rendering Lahaul and Spiti districts north of the pass
                        inaccessible, a need was felt to build a tunnel under the pass. The project was announced by the
                        then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on 3 June 2000. The work was entrusted to BRO on 6 May
                        2002. The foundation stone of the project was laid on 28 June 2010 by Sonia Gandhi in her
                        capacity as the Chairperson of National Advisory Council. The road tunnel called Atal Tunnel has
                        been excavated and became operational on 3rd October 2020 after formal inauguration by Prime
                        Minister Narendra Modi. It obviates the need to travel over the Rohtang Pass. While it takes 4
                        to 6 hours to ascend, negotiate and descend the Rohtang Pass, travel through the Rohtang Tunnel
                        takes only about 30 minutes. </p>

                    <p>Tiger Hill (2,590 m) is located in Darjeeling, in the Indian State of West Bengal. It has a panoramic view of Mount Everest and Mount Kanchenjunga together. <br><br> It is 11 km from the town of Darjeeling and can be reached either by jeep or by foot through Chowrasta, Alubari or Jorebangla and then climbing up the incline to the summit.[1][2]

                        Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. <br><br> At sunrise, the peaks of Kanchenjunga are illuminated before the sun is seen at lower elevations. From Tiger Hill, Mount Everest (8848 m) is just visible. Kanchenjunga (8598 m) looks higher than Mt. Everest, owing to the curvature of the Earth, as it is several miles closer than Everest. The distance in a straight line from Tiger Hill to Everest is 107 miles (172 km).[3][4]

                        On a clear day, Kurseong is visible to the south and in the distance, along with Teesta River, Mahananda River, Balason River and Mechi River meandering down to the south.[5] Chumal Rhi mountain of Tibet, 84 miles (135 km) away, is visible over the Chola range.</p>
